# My Networking Projects
This repository serves as a collection of networking projects designed to enhance my technical knowledge and practical skills in IT. Each project focuses on key networking concepts such as subnetting, routing, and network configuration, reinforcing my understanding as I progress in my IT journey.

# Project List:
## 1) [Subnetting, Network Configuration and Management](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/001-Subnetting-Network-Configuration-and-Management)
This project focuses on subnetting an allocated network into smaller subnets to accommodate multiple network segments. It involves configuring IP addressing, ensuring proper device communication within each subnet, and enabling external network access. The primary objective is to establish a well-structured network that supports efficient IP address allocation and seamless connectivity.

## 2) [Optimizing Network Subnetting and Configuration for Site Expansion](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/002-Optimizing-Network-Subnetting-and-Configuration-for-Site-Expansion)
As organizations grow, network expansion becomes necessary to accommodate new sites and devices while conserving IP address space. This project builds upon the previous subnetting and configuration setup, optimizing the network to support an additional site while maintaining connectivity. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the project ensures that all devices can communicate efficiently while implementing best practices for IP address utilization and network scalability.

## 3) [Implementing Routing Protocol for Inter-Site Connectivity in a Subnetted Network](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/003-Implementing-Routing-Protocol-for-Inter-Site-Connectivity-in-a-Subnetted-Network)
In modern network infrastructures, efficient routing is essential to ensure seamless communication between different sites. This project involves configuring and implementing the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) to enable full network connectivity between two locations: San Francisco and New York. Prior to configuring EIGRP, devices within each site could communicate locally, but inter-site communication was not possible. The goal of this project is to enable dynamic routing using EIGRP so that devices from both sites can reach each other efficiently.

## 4) Coming Soon!
