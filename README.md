# My Networking Projects

# Project List:
1) [Subnetting, Network Configuration and Management](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/001-Subnetting-Network-Configuration-and-Management)
  - The aim of the project is to subdivide an allocated subnet into four networks and ensure devices can access external networks (the Internet).

2) [Optimizing Network Subnetting and Configuration for Site Expansion](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/002-Optimizing-Network-Subnetting-and-Configuration-for-Site-Expansion)
  - The aim of this project is to extend a previously configured small-scale network with multiple subnets and internet connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer. Building upon the previous project (Project_01), we will extend and conserve IP addresses for network expansion in Project_02.

3) [Implementing EIGRP for Inter-Site Connectivity in a Subnetted Network](https://github.com/caxylive/Net_Projects/tree/main/projects/003-Implementing-EIGRIP-for-Inter-Site-Connectivity-in-a-Subnetted-Network)
  - In modern network infrastructures, efficient routing is essential to ensure seamless communication between different sites. This project involves configuring and implementing the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) to enable full network connectivity between two locations: San Francisco and New York. Prior to configuring EIGRP, devices within each site could communicate locally, but inter-site communication was not possible. The goal of this project is to enable dynamic routing using EIGRP so that devices from both sites can reach each other efficiently.
